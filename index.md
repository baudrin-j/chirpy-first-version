I work on symmetric cryptography and discrete mathematics.

Since September 2021, I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Anne Canteaut](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/Anne.Canteaut/) & [Léo Perrin](https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/), whithin the [COSMIQ](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/) team, at Inria.

During my first years of PhD, I mainly cryptanalyzed **symmetric** primitives, especially **lightweight** ones, such as *Ascon* (winner of the NIST lightweight competition) or *Midori*.

More recently, I started studying **Boolean functions**, and more specifically their cryptographic properties such as **APN**-ness (Almost Perfect Non-linear functions).

I am also part of some workgroups whose purposes are to **design** new primitives either for new use cases or focused on extreme performances.
