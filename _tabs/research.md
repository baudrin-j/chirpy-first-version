I work on **symmetric cryptography** and **discrete mathematics**.
During my first years of PhD, I mainly cryptanalyzed *symmetric primitives*, especially *lightweight* ones, such as $\mathsf{Ascon}$ (winner of the NIST lightweight competition) or $\mathsf{Midori}$. More recently, I started studying **Boolean functions**, and more specifically their cryptographic properties such as APN-ness (Almost Perfect Non-linear functions). I also take part in the **design** of new primitives either for new use cases or focused on extreme performances.
