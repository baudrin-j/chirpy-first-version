## Research
In September 2021, I started doctoral studies under the supervision of [Anne Canteaut](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/Anne.Canteaut/) & [Léo Perrin](https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/), within Inria [COSMIQ](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/) team.

I work on symmetric cryptography and discrete mathematics. 
During my first years of PhD, I mainly cryptanalyzed *symmetric primitives*, especially *lightweight* ones, such as *Ascon* (winner of the NIST lightweight competition) or *Midori*.

More recently, I started studying Boolean functions, and more specifically their cryptographic properties such as APN-ness (Almost Perfect Non-linear functions).

I am also part of some workgroups whose purposes are to design new primitives either for new use cases or focused on extreme performances.

## Teaching
Besides, I am in charge of weekly tutorials at [UVSQ](https://www.uvsq.fr) (Université Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, Versailles, France).
