- python-l1: 
  title-en: Foundations of computer science 1 - Introduction to Python
  title-fr: Fondements de l'informatique 1 - Initiation Python
  shortname: LSIN100
  year: 
    - 2021
  level: Licence 1
  period: from September to December
  hours: 36h
  format: 3h/week during 12 weeks
  lecturer: Yann Rotella
  description: "This is an introductory course to programming for first-year students. \
  The programming language used is Python. The objective is the understanding of the basic \
  notions: conditional and iterative structures, functions, and lists. During the last class,
  Git is presented."

- crypto-l3:
  title-en: Cryptography L3
  title-fr: Cryptographie
  shortname: LSIN603
  level: Licence 3
  year: 
    - 2022
  period: from February to May
  hours: 36h
  format: 3h/week during 12 weeks
  lecturer: Christina Boura
  description: "This course is an introduction to cryptography. It starts from \
  historical cryptosystems, and in particular with the cryptanalysis of *Enigma*. \
  The first half is then dedicated to symmetric cryptography with the notions of\
  stream ciphers (based on LFSRs), block ciphers (based on Feistel networks, such as *DES*), \
  but also modes of operations. After recalling the necessary background in \
  modular arithmetic, we focus on asymmetric cryptography with RSA, \
  or ElGamal cryptosystems, or Diffie-Hellman key-exchange. \
  Finally, signatures and hash functions are studied."

- complement-algo-m1:
  title-en: Complementary course in algorithmic 
  title-fr: Complément d'algorithmique et compléxité
  shortname: MIN17102
  level: Master 1
  year: 
    - 2022
  period: in September
  hours: 15h
  format: Intensive course with five 3-hour tutorial over 2 weeks
  lecturer: Sandrine Vial
  description: "This is a refresher course common to multiple masters which \
  occurs at the very beginning of the first year of master. The aim is to go \
  through the main notions of algorithmics, with a particular attention given to \
  the computation of time complexity. The main search, insertion, and sorting algorithms \
  are for instance surveyed. This is also the case of the basic data structures."

- complement-math-m1:
  title-en: Complementary course in discrete mathematics 
  title-fr: Complément de mathématiques discrètes
  shortname: MIN17101
  level: Master 1
  year: 
    - 2022
    - 2023
  period: in September
  hours: 15h
  format: Intensive course with five 3-hour tutorial over 2 weeks
  lecturer: Franck Quessette & Yann Rotella
  description: "This is a refresher course common to multiple masters which \
  occurs at the very beginning of the first year of master. The aim is to go \
  through the main notions of discrete mathematics that are needed in multiple courses, \
  and especially the cryptography course. The first half of the course is focused \ 
  on algebra structures (groups, rings, fields) and on the usage of classical results \
  such as the (extended) Euclidean division or the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The \
  second half is dedicated to discrete probability. The main objective is to ensure\
  that the students can conduct a simple line of reasoning with precision."

- math-l2:
  title-en: Mathematics for computer science
  title-fr: Mathématiques pour l'informatique
  shortname: LSIN310
  level: Licence 2
  year: 
    - 2022
  period: from September to December
  hours: 36h
  format: 3h/week during 12 weeks
  lecturer: Christina Boura
  description: "This is an introductory course to mathematics of license level. \
  The course starts by focusing on the notions of function, order/equivalence relations, \
  or inductive reasoning. Then modular arithmetic rules are studied, the ultimate goal being \
  the understanding and usage of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Finally, the computational \
  aspects of linear algebra are tackled: addition/multiplications of matrices, computation of \
  determinants, and of course inversion."

- crypto-m1:
  title-en: Cryptography M1
  title-fr: Cryptographie
  shortname: MIN15122
  level: Master 1
  year: 
    - 2023
  period: from September to December
  hours: 36h
  format: 3h/week during 12 weeks
  lecturer: Louis Goubin
  description: "This course is focused on cryptography, and especially on symmetric \
  cryptography. After looking at basic combinatorics results and historical cryptosystems, \
  two of the most famous symmetric ciphers are cryptanalyzed. First, we go through the DES \
  and the reason to be of each of its internal components. This is an opportunity to understand\
  the importance of non-linear operations and the power of the Feistel structure. Then,\
  we do the same with the AES, and introduce some powerful attacks such as differential or \
  integral attacks. We then look at generic attacks, in particular on 2-DES, but also leveraging \
  time-memory trade-off based on the birthday paradox. We finally mention message authentication codes, \
  but also the asymmetric RSA cipher and some fault injection attacks against it."

  title-en: Web applications and security
  title-fr: Applications Web et Sécurité
  shortname: MIN17217
  level: Master 1
  year: 
    - 2024
  period: from February to May
  hours: 15h
  format: five 3-hour tutorials over 2 months
  lecturer: Yann Rotella
  description: "Web programming course for first-year master students, \
  with a specific attention to web security. After a few lectures, \
  the students are split into groups of 4 and freely choose a project that \
  should be delivered in about 2 months. During these two months, \
  five sessions are organized to make sure that everything is in order \
  thanks to a 1-page report and a small presentation."
